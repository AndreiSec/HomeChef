# HomeChef

## Instructions to run

First, install Python 3.xx and Node.js.

Next, open two terminals, one in ./Backend and one in ./Frontend

### In the ./Backend terminal, enter the following commands and wait for them to execute fully:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. flask run

### In the ./Frontend terminal, enter the following commands:

1. npm i
2. npm run start

After these steps are done, you will be presented with HomeChef login on the browser. To login, just enter any username / password (as register features have been disabled for this implementation).
